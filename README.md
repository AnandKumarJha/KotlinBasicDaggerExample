# KotlinBasicDaggerExample
This is basic example of Dagger in Kotlin

As we know the Dagger2 is Very useful tool for dependency framwork. Dependency Injection is a design pattern, or you can say a concept of Object Oriented Programming, where we donâ€™t create an object of another class inside a class using the new keyword (for Java). Instead, we supply the needed object from outside.

Advantage
* Its performance is high because the objects are created at compile time.
* UT easy to write with loose coupled code
* Easy removal of boilerplate code.
* Easy creation of objects having multiple parameters in constructor with complex hierarchy of multiple parameter object creation.
